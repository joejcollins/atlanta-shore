# Beavers, Botany and Biodiversity

A volunteer lead study of the effects of the introduction of beavers
on botanical biodiversity.

Beavers were reintroduced to the [Spains Hall Estate](https://www.spainshallestate.co.uk/nfm_beavers)
in 2019 
as part of a re-wilding and natural flood management programme.
Since then the beavers have started a family
and transformed their environment to suit their needs.

Every year a botanical survey has been conducted to monitor how the botany
of the beaver introduction site has been transformed under beaver management.

This is an on going study and both the data and analysis are Open Source.
