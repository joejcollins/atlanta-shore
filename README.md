# Beavers and Botany

## Background

A volunteer lead study of the effects of the introduction of beavers
on botanical biodiversity.

Beavers were reintroduced to the [Spains Hall Estate](https://www.spainshallestate.co.uk/nfm_beavers)
in 2019 
as part of a re-wilding and natural flood management programme.
Since then the beavers have started a family
and transformed their environment to suit their needs.

Every year a botanical survey has been conducted to monitor how the botany
of the beaver introduction site has been transformed under beaver management.
