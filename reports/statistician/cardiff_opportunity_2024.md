# Background

In 2019, the Spains Hall Estate, Essex,
initiated a nature recovery and flood reduction program by introducing beavers
into a fenced enclosure.
A comprehensive annual botanical survey has been conducted
to assess the impact of the beaver introduction on plant assemblages within the enclosure.
Geolocated images were captured at each survey point,
covering canopy and ground vegetation.

In the summer of 2023, beavers were introduced into two additional enclosures.
Data from the first enclosure will be utilized
to predict the timeline for biodiversity gains in the new enclosures.
The objective is to employ machine learning techniques
to predict Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs)
and British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) from geolocated images.
This predictive model aims to confirm changes in biodiversity as they occur,
eliminating the necessity for a detailed botanical survey.

# Objective

Utilize machine learning techniques to predict Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs)
and British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) from geolocated images.
The focus is on automatically extracting features,
such as shape descriptors and leaf area index,
to generate a model predicting EIVs and NVC for images from the two additional enclosures.

# Collaborative Team

Whilst the Spains Hall estate is a commercial enterprise,
this is a volunteer lead study
run by a collaborative team consisting of:

* Sarah Brockless - Ecologist [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-brockless-833291a7/).
* Joe Collins - Software Engineer [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joejcollins/).
* Mags Cousins - Botanist [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mags-Cousins).
* Dave Gasca - Hydrologist [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gasca-7830537/).

The team would welcome input from a data scientist.

# Opportunity Details

* **Data Availability** This is an open source project
and the data thus far is available on [Github](https://github.com/joejcollins/atlanta-shore).
* **Tools** The project uses both R and Python for data preparation and statistical analysis.
Some familiarity with Git is needed but training can be given.
* **Survey Assistance** There will be an opportunity to assist with the botanical survey,
at the Spains Hall Estate,
20-24 June 2024.
* **Contact** For further information contact Joe Collins at <j.collins@zengenti.com>.
