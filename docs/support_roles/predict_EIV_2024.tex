\section*{Description}

In 2019, the Spains Hall Estate, Essex, initiated a nature recovery and natural flood management program by introducing beavers, into a fenced enclosure https://www.spainshallestate.co.uk/nfm\_beavers.  Comprehensive monitoring of the hydrology, canopy cover, and botanical species composition has been conducted each year (2019-2023) to assess the impact of beavers within the enclosure.  The data from these surveys is freely available at https://github.com/joejcollins/atlanta-shore.  An additional survey will be conducted in mid summer 2024.

In the summer of 2023, more beavers were introduced elsewhere on the estate.  It would be useful to know the expected timeline for the effects of these new introductions to determine potential Biodiversity Net Gains and improvements in Ecosystem Services. 

The project uses R for statistical analysis and Python for data cleaning and preparation. Some familiarity with Git is needed but training can be given. The team includes the estate manager, two ecologists, a hydrologist and a software engineer, and would welcome input from a data scientist.

\section*{Comments}

The project's objective is to develop a model that can predict Indicator Values (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_value) at the newly established beaver release sites. These values serve as indicators of environmental conditions such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, and light availability. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model will be trained to forecast Indicator Values for arbitrary locations and timeframes.

Once the model is trained and validated, it will be deployed to generate annual predictions and maps illustrating the anticipated changes in Indicator Values at the release sites for the next five years. These forecasts will provide valuable insights into how the ecosystem is expected to evolve and adapt following the introduction of beavers. Additionally, the project will compute confidence limits for these predictions, providing users with an understanding of the uncertainty associated with the forecasts.

If possible, the project aims to package the model into a web-based tool or application. This platform will allow users, such as land managers to explore and interact with the predicted environmental changes. Users should be able to visualise the forecasted Indicator Values spatially on maps, examine temporal trends, and assess the potential impacts on ecosystem dynamics.
