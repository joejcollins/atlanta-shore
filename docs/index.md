# Beavers and Botany

## Background

A study of the effects of the introduction of beavers on botanical biodiversity.
Beavers were reintroduced to the [Spains Hall Estate](https://www.spainshallestate.co.uk/nfm_beavers) in 2019 
as part of a program of nature recovery and natural flood reduction.
Since then the beavers have started a family
and transformed their environment to suit their needs.
Every year a botanical survey has been conducted to monitor how the botany
of the beaver introduction site has been transformed under beaver management.

## Objectives

1. Evaluate techniques for monitoring the effects of beaver introductions.
1. Create a model to predict the timeline for the effects of beaver introductions.
1. Create an automated tool for predicting moisture and light levels from digital images.

## Data and Analysis

This is an on going study and both the data and analysis in Open Source.
You can take and look an run the analyses yourself on Gitpod.
